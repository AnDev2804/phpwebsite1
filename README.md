# Mini Web Page Project: Donor Registration & Genetic Offspring Predictions

### 🌐 Built with PHP, HTML, CSS & FPDF Framework

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This mini web project is one of my first Web Development projects, created during my college days. It utilizes **PHP** for server-side logic, combined with **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **FPDF** framework for generating PDFs.

⚠️ **Note:** All tests and development were performed on a **local server**.

The entire project relies on **text files** as the data storage mechanism, so no database integration is required. The project is divided into **three main modules**, each with its unique functionality.

## 🚀 Features & Modules

1. ### 🧾 **Module 1: Donor Registration**

   - All data is stored in text files.

2. ### 👫 **Module 2: Offspring Predictions for Couples**
   - **Parents** can fill out a form, entering the required genetic data. 
   - The system calculates and displays the possible **genetic combinations** of their offspring based on the samples provided by both the father and the mother.

3. ### 👩‍🍼 **Module 3: Offspring Predictions for Single Women**
   - This module allows **single women** to search for potential **donors** based on the desired genetic traits.
